# VB.net Programs

This repository contains a wide variety of the programs I've written in Visual Basic.net. Many of these projects do a good core job at illustrating certain algorithms at hand, as well as a lot of key programming concepts such as object orientated programming, inheritence, and control flow. Many programs also contain visuals as well as animations. Overall, I feel like this selection of programs are a great resource for beginners or intermediates to take a look at and analyze. Not to mention, it's always a fun experience to play around with windows form applications as they allow for a lot of customization.

## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/aahmad4/Collection-of-Visual-Basic-Programs
```

## Usage

Once you clone the repository, you'll notice that each program is organized into its own folder. Upon opening a folder, there will be a .sln file available at hand. Opening that file will launch Microsoft Visual Studio, which will allow you to open all the form designers as well as the form coding blocks. To run each program simply hit the green run button in the development enviornment.

Ex.
```
Candy.sln
```
